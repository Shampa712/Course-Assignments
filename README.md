# Assignments 4 - Logit Models and Air Quality Analysis
This repository contains the source files for my Assignment 4, which involves analyzing air quality data using logit regression models.

## Contents

`Assignment_4.Rmd`: This is the R Markdown file used to generate the report.

`Assignment_4.html`: This is the rendered HTML output of the R Markdown file.

`Air_Quality 2024NYC.csv`: The dataset used for the data analysis.

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to:
1.  Discuss the challenges of interpreting interaction terms in logit models and the benefits of using simulation-based approaches.
2.  Estimate a series of logit models with increasing complexity, perform likelihood ratio tests, and use AIC and BIC to select the best model.

## Data Description
The `Air_Quality 2024NYC.csv` dataset contains air quality measurements for New York City. The analysis focuses on creating a binary variable based on `Data.Value` and building logit models to predict this binary outcome.
